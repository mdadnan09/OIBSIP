            <p>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, commonly known as Mahatma Gandhi, was an Indian lawyer, anti-colonial nationalist, and political ethicist who employed nonviolent resistance to lead the successful campaign for India's independence from British rule.</p>
            <p>Born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, Gujarat, India, Gandhi studied law in London and became a barrister. He returned to India and advocated for the rights of Indians, fighting against discriminatory practices and social injustices.</p>
            <p>Gandhi's philosophy of nonviolent civil disobedience, which he called Satyagraha, played a crucial role in India's struggle for independence. He led various peaceful protests and acts of civil disobedience, such as the famous Salt March, which galvanized the Indian population and garnered international attention.</p>
            <p>Gandhi's teachings and principles continue to inspire people around the world. He emphasized the power of truth, love, and nonviolence, and his approach has been influential in many civil rights movements and campaigns for social justice.</p>
